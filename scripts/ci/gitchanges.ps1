.SYNOPSIS
    This script generates a list of changed files in the locally checked out branch and outputs
    that list to a file.
.DESCRIPTION
    Generates a file containing a list of all modified files (added/modified) in
    the checked out branch. The output file contains a list that is newline delimited, for
    example:

    Assets/MixedRealityToolkit.SDK/AssemblyInfo.cs
    Assets/MixedRealityToolkit.Tests/PlayModeTests/ManipulationHandlerTests.cs

    The file will not contain files that have been completely deleted (for example, if
    a change deleted Assets/MixedRealityToolkit.SDK/DeletedFile.cs), that line will not exist
    in the output file.

    Note that this script assumes that the local git repo doesn't already contain the
    target branch (e.g. main). This is what happens by default on Azure DevOps
    pipeline integrations with GitHub pull requests.

    In particular, this will checkout (via this command:
    git fetch --force --tags --prune --progress --no-recurse-submodules origin $(System.PullRequest.TargetBranch))
.EXAMPLE
    .\gitchanges.ps1 -OutputFile c:\path\to\changes\file.txt -RepoRoot c:\path\to\mrtk -TargetBranch main
#>
param(
    # The target branch that the pull request will merge into (e.g. main)
    [string]$TargetBranch,

    # The output filename (e.g. c:\path\to\output.txt)
    [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
    [string]$OutputFile,

    # The root folder of the repo (e.g. c:\repo)
    # This primarily used to filter out files that were deleted.
    [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
    [string]$RepoRoot
)

# The pull request ID might not be present (i.e. this is an adhoc build being spun up)
# and the target branch might not be set in which case there's nothing to validate.
if ([string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($TargetBranch)) {
    Write-Warning "TargetBranch isn't specified, skipping."
    exit 0;
}

# If the output file already exists, blow it away. Each run should get a new set of changed files.

# the set of changed files between two different commit stamps (or branches, in this case), and needs
