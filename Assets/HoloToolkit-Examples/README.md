# HoloToolkit-Examples

This folder will host test scenes and assets that verify functionality of HoloToolkit-Unity components and host samples/examples that exemplify the HoloToolkit to help solve interesting scenarios.

The reason these are examples is because they are specific scenarios which may be difficult to make a into a generic prefab.

#### When considering an example:

1. Examples are not like unit tests which exist in the UnitTests folder of each feature area.  Scenes in this folder may be automated and moved into HoloToolkit-UnitTests when/if such tests are written for them.
2. Examples are ideas which use the HoloToolkit to show developers how they can solve problems on HoloLens using Unity.
3. Examples that are more of an end-end app, do not fit into the HoloToolkit-Examples folder.
4. Examples that are not maintained regularly will be deprecated.

#### When adding an example:

1. Create a new folder under HoloToolkit-Examples and give it a name that best describes your project.
2. You can add your example scenes under that folder.
3. Ensure you add a README.md so developers can read about the purpose and steps to run your example code.
4. Do not change the Project Settings for HoloToolkit-Unity with updates specific to your example.
