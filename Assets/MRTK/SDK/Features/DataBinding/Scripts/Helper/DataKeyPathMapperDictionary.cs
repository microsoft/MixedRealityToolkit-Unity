    /// A simple key path mapper that can associated a local key path with a data key path.
    ///
    /// To allow for the existence of common data presentation prefabs that can be reused,
    /// such as a address book entry, a photo album entry, or even a simple list of text entries,
    /// there is a need to decouple namespaces between these prefab "views" and the data sources
    /// that will be used to populate the view.
    ///
    /// The data source field names for the various potential sources of similar information
    /// (eg. contact list, or photo album entries), are unlikely to be consistent across
    /// data sources, but the desire is to be able to map them to curated prefab views
    /// that can present this information in compelling ways.

    /// components and editor inspector, see DataKeyPathMapperGODictionary.
