  "description": "MRTK non-Canvas UX component library, for building 3D UX without Canvas layout. For most production-grade UI, we recommend the dynamic hybrid Canvas-based UX systems, located in com.microsoft.mrtk.uxcomponents. However, in some circumstances, static/non-Canvas UI may offer improved performance and batching, and may be desirable in resource-constrained scenarios.",
