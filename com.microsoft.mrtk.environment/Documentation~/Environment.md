# Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit Environment

The environment package contains features that enable developers to easily work with spatial awareness and virtual reality boundaries.

> [!NOTE]
> The environment package is in early preview and does not contain all of the planned features. The existing features
> may undergo major, breaking architectural changes before release.

## Boundary subsystem

The boundary subsystem centralizes data from the Unity XR subsystems to simplify the steps required to access boundary data.

> [!NOTE]
> The boundary subsystem is an early implementation for which we are requesting feedback. If the community determines it is not useful, it may be removed in a future preview release.

## Visualizations

An initial collection of spatial awareness visualizations are provided in the `Visualizers/SpatialMesh` folder.
