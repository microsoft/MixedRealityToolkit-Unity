    ///  Interface for all data sources. A data source is any managed set of data
    ///  that can be used to populate a data view via a data consumer. This data
    ///  can be static or dynamic, with any changes being reported to any data consumers
    ///  who have registered to receive change notifications.
    ///
    /// Key concepts:
    ///
    /// Key Path (string) - a unique accessor to specific data items within a data set.
    ///   Although a Key Path can be any unique identifier per data item, all
    ///   current implementations use the concept of a logical user readable
    ///   specifier that indicates the navigational position of the data of interest
    ///   relative to the entire data set. It is modelled on javascript's concept of
    ///   lists, dictionaries and primitives, such that keypaths are correct javascript
    ///   statements for accessing data that can be represented in JSON. The advantage
    ///   of this approach is that it correlates very well with both JSON and XML,
    ///   which are the two most prevalent means of transferring information from back-end services.
    ///
    ///   Example key paths:
    ///
    ///   temperature
    ///   contacts[10].firstName
    ///   contacts
    ///   contacts[10].addresses[3].city
    ///   [10].title
    ///   kingdom.animal.mammal.aardvark.diet.foodtypes.termites
    ///
    ///   Given that a key path is an arbitrary string with no required taxonomy, the actual
    ///   data specifiers could be any method of describing what data to retrieve. XML's XPath is an
    ///   example of a viable key path schema. As long as key paths provided by the data consumer
    ///   are consistent with the keypaths expected by the data source, everything will work.
    ///   Furthermore Key Path Mappers can be implemented to translate between different schemas.
    ///
    ///   Resolving a keypath means combining two keypaths: 1) a keypath describes how to access a specific
    ///   subset of a larger dataset, such as one entry in a list of many entries, and 2)
    ///   a partial (relative) keypath that represents just a datum within that list or map entry.
    ///   This makes it possible to treat a subset of the data in such a way that it does
    ///   not matter where in a larger data set hierarchy it actually exists. The most critical
    ///   use of this ability is to describe the data of a single entry in a list without worrying about which
    ///   entry in that list the current instance is referencing.
    ///
    /// Key Path Mapper (IDataKeyPathMapper) - A dependency injected helper that can map
    ///   between namespaces used in a data set and name spaces used in a view object, like
    ///   a prefab meant to be re-usable with different data sources, like a contact list.
    ///
    /// Data Consumer (IDataConsumer) - An object that knows how to consume information being managed by
    ///   a data source and use that data to populate data views.
    ///
    /// Data Consumer Listener - Data Consumers that have registered to be notified of any changes to a specific
    ///   data item in a dataset. Whenever the data specified has changed (or suspected to have changed), the
    ///   Data Consumer(s) will be notified.
    ///
    /// Collection - Any subset of the data source that is a repeated array of the same types of information. This
    ///   special consideration of the structure of the data is critical for populating list views where items
    ///   are presented in a list.  Data sources and data consumers can support nested lists, such as a list of keywords
    ///   associated with each photo in a list of photos. The keypath for the keywords would be relative to the photo,
    ///   and the keypath for the photos would be relative to the list, and the keypath of the list would be relative
    ///   to either the nearest parent list, or the root of the data set.
