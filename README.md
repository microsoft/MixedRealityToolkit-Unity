# What is the Mixed Reality Toolkit

MRTK-Unity is a Microsoft-driven project that provides a set of components and features, used to accelerate cross-platform MR app development in Unity. Here are some of its functions:

* Provides the **cross-platform input system and building blocks for spatial interactions and UI**.
* Enables **rapid prototyping** via in-editor simulation that allows you to see changes immediately.
* Operates as an **extensible framework** that provides developers the ability to swap out core components.
* **Supports a wide range of platforms**:

| Platform | Supported Devices |
|:---|:---|
| OpenXR (Unity 2020.3) | Microsoft HoloLens 2 <br> Windows Mixed Reality headsets |
| Windows Mixed Reality | Microsoft HoloLens <br> Microsoft HoloLens 2 <br> Windows Mixed Reality headsets  |
| Oculus (Unity 2019.3 or newer) | Oculus Quest |
| OpenVR |  Windows Mixed Reality headsets <br> HTC Vive <br> Oculus Rift |
| Ultraleap Hand Tracking | Ultraleap Leap Motion controller |
| Mobile | iOS and Android |

# Getting started with MRTK

If you're new to MRTK or Mixed Reality development in Unity, **we recommend you start at the beginning of our** [Unity development journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/unity-development-overview?tabs=mrtk%2Chl2) in the Microsoft Docs. The Unity development journey is specifically tailored to walk new developers through the installation, core concepts, and usage of MRTK.

| IMPORTANT: The Unity development journey currently uses **MRTK version 2.7.0** and **Unity 2020.3**. |
