# Eye Tracking in the Mixed Reality Toolkit

The [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) (MRTK) supports amongst others _'HoloLens 2'_ which offers an exciting and powerful new input: Eye Tracking! 
Eye Tracking enables users to quickly and effortlessly engage with holograms across their view and can make your system smarter by better identifying a user's intention.
