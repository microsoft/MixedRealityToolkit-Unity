# Hologram stabilization

## Performance 

In order for the underlying platform and device to produce the best results, it is important to achieve performant framerates. The target framerate (ex: 60 FPS or 90 FPS) will vary across platform and devices. Mixed reality applications meeting framerate will have stable holograms as well as efficient head tracking, hand tracking and more. 

Consult platform-specific reference that may be unique to that endpoint.
