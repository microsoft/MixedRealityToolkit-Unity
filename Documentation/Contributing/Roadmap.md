## Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) Roadmap

The Mixed Reality Toolkit is an all-new product, built to be cross MR/AR/VR/XR platform by design. There are two planned pre-releases after which the Mixed Reality Toolkit will become the primary product.

The Mixed Reality Toolkit will require Unity 2018.4.

> When Unity releases an LTS (Long Term Support) product, the Mixed Reality Toolkit will update to the LTS release. MRTK will also support the latest non-beta (ex: 2019.1) tech branch version of Unity, at the time at which MRTK was released.

### 2.3.0

The version 2.3.0 plan has been finalized. While some details may change as the iteration progresses, the following describes the overall plan for the next MRTK release. For the latest status of the release, please visit the [milestone page]( https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/milestone/10).

Status: In development

Timeline: January 2029

Themes:

- Stability
- Developer education
- Unity 2019.3 XR SDK support
- User Experience
- Iterate on mobile AR support

**Stability**

Quality and stability are the top priority for this and all Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit releases. We will continue to prioritize customer and partner issues that impact the stability of MRTK components.

The MRTK build and deploy tools remain a continued area of stability and quality focus.

**Developer education**

[Developer documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) and example scenes are, like stability, an ongoing priority for the MRTK team.

**Unity 2019.3 XR SDK support**

XR SDK is Unity's new mixed reality platform. The Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit is committed to supporting our customers on this new platform. All new platform support in MRTK is expected to be delivered via XR SDK.

**User Experience**

User experience (UX) work will include:

- Bug fixes
- Making it easier to add MRTK UX elements to projects
- Bounding box and manipulator updates
- New features
    - Tap to place (HoloToolkit feature)
    - Follow solver (https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues/5713)

**Iterate on mobile AR**

The Mixed Reality Toolkit will gain experimental support for spatial awareness (planes and points) on mobile AR platforms (Android ARCore and iOS ARKit) via ARFoundation. Refinements to the camera support module shipped in version 2.2.0 are also planned.

### 2.4.0
