# Using MRTK in large projects

This page contains some useful tips for consumers of MRTK that are pulling it into existing
large projects, or setting up something new that will be source controlled and have multiple
developers.

*We recommend reading all of the guidelines below, following them will help avoid
some tricky issues when working on larger codebases*

## gitignore

The following .gitignore file is a recommended base to pull in when consuming MRTK - there
parts of MRTK that creates local state that can be safely ignored by source control, which
would otherwise dirty local git state.

Note that the beginning parts of this are taken from the default github Unity .gitignore with
MRTK-specific additions later. Also note that some of these rules assume certain paths, and
can be modified based on where MRTK is located within your project.

```
# This .gitignore file should be placed at the root of your Unity project directory

## ProjectPreferences.asset file

Project-wide MRTK settings can be found under the Edit -> Project Settings
-> Mixed Reality Toolkit location. These settings will be saved to a file
at this location in the Assets folder:

```
Assets/MixedRealityToolkit.Generated/ProjectPreferences.asset
```

If your project will have multiple collaborators, it is recommended that
this asset file be checked in after doing an initial setup of MRTK
settings. In particular, consider having the **following settings checked**:

**Lock SDK Profiles** - If this is disabled, the default MRTK profiles will be
globally editable, which will make MRTK upgrades challenging (it can lead
to merge conflicts in the framework itself)

**Ignore MRTK project configurator** - If this is disabled, the project
configurator will show if the current MRTK settings do not match MRTK
recommended defaults. Since your project may have explicitly chosen not to
have some settings enabled, having this setting checked will prevent other
collaborators from seeing this dialog an changing settings
inadvertently. These settings should be configured by the person setting up
the project and then ignored by the other collaborators.

**Auto-enable UWP capabilities** - If this is disabled, certain functionality (for example, eye tracking) may silently fail when deployed
to a device because Unity won't automatically add the required runtime
capabilities to the application manifest. Having this setting checked will
safeguard your application deployment experience from this class of issues.
